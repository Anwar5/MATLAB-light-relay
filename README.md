# MATLAB-light-relay
A student project for ENGR114 at Portland Community College. Uses MATLAB connected to an Arudino over serial to control a relay that swithes a light on and off..

## Hardware Setup
### Assembly of Light Relay Components :

Step 1: Lay out all the components on the relay board following the instruction from

and solder all components in place.

Step 2: Prepare the box by drilling two holes on either end for the power cord. Also cut out two access holes for the USB and adapter cables.

Step 3: Temporarily install stand-offs on the red board and relay board; add a small drop of super glue then position inside box with outlets towards previously made cut-outs.

Step 4: Feed the power cables inside the box. Connect the two white wires together and the two ground wires together. Then feed the two black wires in the blue terminal block of the relay into the two right-hand most slots (order depends on the code order).

Step 5: Connect the three jumper cables as shown below:

Step 6: Tuck in all loose wires and create a loop in the power cord and secure with zip ties to provide strain relief.
Step 7: Screw on lid to complete.
